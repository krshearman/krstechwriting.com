Conceived by Tony Tam and SmartBear Software, Swagger aimed to bring clarity and consistency to the often complex world of API development. Swagger introduced a specification for API descriptions in JSON or YAML format, providing a machine-readable blueprint that could be easily understood by both humans and computers.</li>

In 2015, the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) was formed, bringing together industry leaders such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, and others. The goal was to establish a standardized, open-source framework that would evolve from the Swagger specification. Thus, OpenAPI was born, inheriting the best practices and community-driven ethos of Swagger.</li>
