                                                        <li class="li">The journey of DITA began with version 1.0, a foundational release that laid the groundwork for its modular and topic-based approach. Over the years, subsequent versions brought refinements, enhancements, and additional features. DITA 1.1 introduced keymaps and domain specialization, while DITA 1.2 focused on improving support for complex technical documentation.</li>
                                                        <li class="li">With DITA 1.3, the framework continued to evolve, incorporating feedback from a growing community of users. This version emphasized improvements in key areas such as troubleshooting, indexing, and specialization, solidifying DITA's position as a flexible and robust solution for structured authoring.</li>
                                                    </ul>

Instead of crafting monolithic documents, DITA encourages the creation of small, self-contained units called topics. These topics cover specific subjects or tasks, fostering content reusability across various documents. For example, a troubleshooting guide might reuse common solutions in different contexts, eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency.</li>
