This article embarks on a historical journey through the evolution of ePub and explores its typical uses, showcasing its pivotal role in the dynamic landscape of electronic literature.</p>

                                                    <ul class="ul">
                                                        <li class="li">The roots of ePub can be traced back to the early 2000s when the concept of electronic books, or e-books, began gaining traction. The proliferation of e-readers and the desire for a standardized format that could adapt to various devices fueled the need for a universal e-book standard. This led to the birth of ePub as a collaborative effort between the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) and key industry players.</li>

                                                        <li class="li">One of the defining features of ePub is its commitment to open standards. By embracing technologies like HTML, CSS, and XML, ePub ensured that e-books could be created and consumed across different platforms seamlessly. This flexibility was a departure from proprietary formats, paving the way for a more inclusive and accessible digital reading experience.</li>

                                                        <li class="li">The journey of ePub has witnessed several iterations, each bringing refinements and enhancements. ePub 2.0, introduced in 2007, marked a significant step forward in standardizing e-book features. It supported reflowable content, making it adaptable to various screen sizes. The subsequent release, ePub 3.0, introduced support for richer multimedia content, interactivity, and improved accessibility features, elevating the e-book experience to new heights.</li>

Unlike fixed-layout formats, reflowable content adapts dynamically to the screen size and font preferences of the reader. This responsive design ensures a consistent and comfortable reading experience across devices, from e-readers to tablets and smartphones.</li>
