                                                        <p class="p">LogicMonitor's static thresholds provide a stable foundation for alerting. Users can define fixed thresholds for various performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or network latency. These thresholds remain constant over time, offering a straightforward way to trigger alerts when specific limits are breached.</p>
                                                    </li>

                                                        <p class="p">Recognizing the dynamic nature of IT environments, LogicMonitor introduces dynamic thresholds. Unlike static thresholds, dynamic thresholds adapt to the changing patterns of your infrastructure. The system analyzes historical performance data to set thresholds dynamically, ensuring that alerts are triggered based on the actual behavior of your systems rather than predetermined limits.</p>

                                                        <p class="p">To further refine the alerting process, LogicMonitor offers alert tuning capabilities. IT teams can suppress alerts during maintenance windows or configure thresholds to ignore minor fluctuations. This feature reduces alert noise, allowing teams to focus on critical issues and preventing unnecessary interruptions during routine operations.</p>
