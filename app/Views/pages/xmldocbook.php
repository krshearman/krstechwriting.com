Its origins can be attributed to the collaboration between SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) enthusiasts and practitioners seeking a markup language specifically tailored for technical documentation.</li>

However, SGML's complexity and the need for simplicity in creating technical documentation led to the birth of DocBook. Recognizing the need for a more accessible and purpose-specific markup language, the DocBook Technical Committee began its work under the umbrella of the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).</li>
