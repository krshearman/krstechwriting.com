            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">The Origins of DITA: From Darwin to Documentation</strong>
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">DITA's roots can be traced back to the early 2000s when it emerged from the collaborative efforts of IBM. Named after Charles Darwin, the father of the theory of evolution, DITA was designed to adapt and evolve with the changing landscape of technical documentation. The initial focus was on creating a standardized, XML-based framework that could accommodate the diverse needs of technical writers across industries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Evolutionary Leap: DITA 1.0 to DITA 1.3</strong>
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li">The journey of DITA began with version 1.0, a foundational release that laid the groundwork for its modular and topic-based approach. Over the years, subsequent versions brought refinements, enhancements, and additional features. DITA 1.1 introduced keymaps and domain specialization, while DITA 1.2 focused on improving support for complex technical documentation.</li>
                    <li class="li">With DITA 1.3, the framework continued to evolve, incorporating feedback from a growing community of users. This version emphasized improvements in key areas such as troubleshooting, indexing, and specialization, solidifying DITA's position as a flexible and robust solution for structured authoring.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">The Anatomy of DITA: Modular Brilliance and Structured Authoring</strong>
                <ul class="ul">
                    <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Modular Brilliance: Topics and Maps</strong>
                        <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">At the heart of DITA is its modular approach to content creation. Instead of crafting monolithic documents, DITA encourages the creation of small, self-contained units called topics. These topics cover specific subjects or tasks, fostering content reusability across various documents. For example, a troubleshooting guide might reuse common solutions in different contexts, eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency.</li>
                            <li class="li">DITA maps act as the orchestrators, providing the structure for assembling and presenting topics in a meaningful order. This modular and map-based approach allows for easy customization of documentation sets, tailoring them to specific audiences or scenarios.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <ul class="ul">
                            <li class="li">Structured authoring is the backbone of DITA's efficiency. By enforcing a predefined structure, DITA enables authors to create content consistently. This structured approach ensures that information is presented uniformly across documents, reducing the likelihood of errors and making it easier for readers to locate and understand key details.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
