                    <strong class="ph b">Static Thresholds for Stability:</strong>
                    <p class="p">LogicMonitor's static thresholds provide a stable foundation for alerting. Users can define fixed thresholds for various performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or network latency. These thresholds remain constant over time, offering a straightforward way to trigger alerts when specific limits are breached.</p>

                    <strong class="ph b">Dynamic Thresholds for Adaptive Alerting:</strong>
                    <p class="p">Recognizing the dynamic nature of IT environments, LogicMonitor introduces dynamic thresholds. Unlike static thresholds, dynamic thresholds adapt to the changing patterns of your infrastructure. The system analyzes historical performance data to set thresholds dynamically, ensuring that alerts are triggered based on the actual behavior of your systems rather than predetermined limits.</p>

                    <p class="p">LogicMonitor allows metric-based customization of thresholds. IT teams can set different thresholds for various performance metrics, tailoring alerting criteria to the unique requirements of each monitored component. This granular customization ensures that alerts are triggered only when specific conditions relevant to each metric are met.</p>
