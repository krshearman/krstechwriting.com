DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) defines a set of elements that serve as building blocks for creating structured, modular, and reusable content. The following is a list of major DITA elements:

<li> (List Item):

<row>:

These are some of the major DITA elements that authors use to structure and organize content. The specific elements used may vary depending on the type of information being conveyed and the DITA specialization in use.
